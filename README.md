# Crates
it's some crate i wrote i rust, and it is linked on another file/used.

to run it, is a long process. first *open the directory in which you saved the two files in*, then type `rustc lib.rs`
then after it's succsessful, `rustc executable.rs --extern math=libmath.rlib && ./executable`, then it will compile and run the file.

After all this is successful, Congratulate yourself, since you've run a crate, and implemented it on another file.

Thank you, and have a nice day.
this is after typing `rustc lib.rs`
